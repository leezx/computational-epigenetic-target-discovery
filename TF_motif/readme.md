Task 1: Deep learning-based model to identify true TF motif binding site in human and mouse genome (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, motif matching)
Goal:
1. given a ChIP-seq, evaluate the direct TF binding regions with motif matching, get direct target genes
2. given an ATAC-seq, get the high-confident putative direct TF binding regions with motif matching, get direct target genes
3. consider TF expression and ATAC-seq, get putative TF interactions

key information:
1. ChIP-seq summit
2. footprinting from ATAC-seq
3. motif matching

new motifs to be validated
1. de novo motif discovery
2. ATAC-seq footprinting validation [deep learning-based footprinting identification]
3. ChIP-seq prediction, putative proteins

TF motifs in cancer
- what are the most cancer-enriched TF motifs based on bulk/scRNA-seq
- does cancer have its specific peaks?
