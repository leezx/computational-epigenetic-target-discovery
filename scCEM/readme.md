identify gene regulatory network from scRNA-seq data in cancer

gene modules

GRNs

annotation by known gene sets

known tools for module identification
- non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
- https://github.com/renozao/NMF

my ideas:
- one gene may belong to multiple modules (just like GO/KEGG)
- coexpression highly depends on cell context!!!
- so, one atlas = one set of modules is not reasonable!
