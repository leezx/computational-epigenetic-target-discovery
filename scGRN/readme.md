scGRN - single-cell gene regulatory network

scCEM to scGRN is a critical step

potential epigenetic driver
- known TF with motif
- known epi factor with public ChIP-seq profile

known tools:
- SCENIC

my ideas:
- public ChIP-Atlas
- public ATAC-seq
- known TF motif matching

key concept: cellular state fingerprint (define by scCEM or scGRN)

key experiments for validation:
- choose a representative cell line that detects the scGRN activity (housekeeping gene)
- single gene study: KD/KO - qRT-PCR, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq
- high-throughput: Perturb-seq

public data mining

-----------------

DepMap pre-filtering
- cell lines that have scGRN activity
- these cell lines depend on the epi-factors

TCGA pre-filtering
- the epi-factors significantly OE in the cancer
